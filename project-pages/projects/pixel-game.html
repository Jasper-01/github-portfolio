          <div class="body-text">This project is a free to choose project. For our group, we decided to make an pixel exploration game. We decided to use Unity, but we create our own assetss. </div>
          <div class="body-text">I am specifically in charge of player behaviour, such as animation for idle, walk, and idle. I am also in charge of designing the game in terms of maps and quizzes, as I have the most experience on games similar to this. This is still an ongoing project. However, we are doing well and we are progressing smoothly. </div>
          <div class="body-text">This has certainly been a challenge for all of us as we have never used C# before, let along the Unity Enginge. Furthermore, most examples online use Unity3D instead of Unity2D, but we are using the latter as it is more convenient and makes more sense to our project. Though we have challenges, we discuss problems we are facing and our progression every Wedneday during class time. We have also learned to read documentation on IDEs, Engines, and Github as a whole for us to progress smoothly together.</div>

              Full Width Image:

                <div class="gallery-image-container">
                  <img src="../../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              Half Width Image: 

                <div class="gallery-image-container half-width">
                  <img src="../../assets/images/IMAGE_NAME" class="gallery-image">

                </div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
