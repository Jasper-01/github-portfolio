        <div class="body-text">Embedded systems are now everywhere alonside cloud computing technology. Thus, through this project, alongside my teammate, we both attempt to make a music application which utilizes a Hanback hardware device, which has other integrated hardware, that is connected to an online cloud server.</div>

          <div class="body-text">This project is a combination of 2 classes meant for 4th year students in Dankook University, which are Cloud Computing and Internet/Mobile Programming. The goal of the classes were to learn AWS services and embedded system programmming respectively. As the professor teaching both classes are the same, he allowed that the project for both classes to be merged, as long as the knowledge from both classes are applied. </div>
          <div class="body-text">Our inspiration for this project are embedded systems in cars. Many automobiles have a control panel accessible to the driver, which usually has many application to assist the driver in many aspects. The issue with music applications is that there are many platforms to listen to music and sometimes there are passengers aside from the driver. Thus, having a fun, good music session in the car can have some inconveniences. </div>
          <div class="body-text">Hence, we attempted to learn about the relavant technology and skills behind the systems, and try to take a step into a more seamless listening experience through this project. However, this project shall only be used for educational purposes due to the Terms of Service from YouTube API for how it is integrated into the system. </div>
          <div class="body-text">An improved version which aims to be used for regular android devices for both Spotify and YouTube are underworks.</div>
