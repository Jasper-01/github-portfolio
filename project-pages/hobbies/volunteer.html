          <div class="body-text"><strong style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Famine 30</strong><br>Famine 30 is a charity event held anually by World Vision. There would be many different sub-groups under World Vision. <br>I was typically under the Ali de Speranza group, as that's where most of the people I knew were in. Participants would go around asking for donations to help those in severe famine. After the donations are collected and totalled, a 2 day 1 night camp lasting 30 hours is held for those ages 15 and above while a 1 day event lasting 8 hours was held for those who were not of age. <br>During the camp / event, participants were not allowed to eat and were given various drinks to last the hours required, On the 1st day, events are held locally by each sub-unit in their local community and location of choice, typically a school, with events, talks, and community prepared performances. On the 2nd day, all sub-units are gathered in a football stadium to attend the concert and countdown to break fast together.</div>
          <div class="body-text"><strong style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Sunway Student  Volunteer</strong><br>In college, I was fortunate to join the volunteer club. 2 notable events that left an impact on me were helping the elderly in poverty buy groceries and giving free medical checkup at the side of the road for the homeless. <br>In the former, my partner and I were assigned a lovely elderly woman whose kids were too busy to visit her most of the year. She was so tight on money that she had to contemplate whether she could afford a bar of chocolate. In the end, my partner and I decided to buy her some chocolate and she teared up while giving us a hug. <br>In the latter, I barely had any time to do anything else but help out wherever I could. I was moved by the compassion the volunteer doctors showed on site despite their fatigure from daily work. </div>
