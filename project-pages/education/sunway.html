          <div class="body-text">I chose Australian Matriculation (AUSMAT for short) in Sunway College, Malaysia. How AUSMAT worked was that 5 subjects are selected, while only 4 of the highest are attribute to the ATAR score, with the maximum being 99 ATAR. I chose 4 core subjects: Physics, Chemistry, Methods Mathematics and English as second language. My 5th subject was a general course which would not be contributed to my ATAR score, which was Computer Science</div>

          <div class="body-text"><strong style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Jiujitsu Club</strong><br>My cousin and brother both spent time learning in their university days. Thus, I have always wanted to be more proactive in learning martial arts all over again. I would train every Tuesday night in the Sunway campus, but gradually went to the neighbouring university, Taylor's College, where the sensei taught Jiujitsu there every Monday as well.  </div>

          <div class="body-text"><strong style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Sunway Student Volunteer</strong><br>I have always held the opinion of helping people whenever and however possible. Thus, once I gotten my driving liscencse, I applied for the volunteer club as they lack students who would be able to drive. I would spend my Saturdays volunteering, especially helping the elderly and those in need of help. </div>

          <div class="body-text"><strong style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Sunway Dance Club</strong><br>I've always loved dancing. I learned ballet from the ages 5 to 17, and had to stop due to studies. I attended K-POP classes because that was the only time slot I could make it in between my other extra curricular activities. Though it was only an hour class, I would sweat a lot by the end of it. It also gives me something to think about other than classes. </div>

          <div class="body-text"><strong style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Sunway Tech Club</strong><br>This club is where I was able to attend big workshops where seniors will teach beginner coding, and guide us on how to further improve our project and works. I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JS and Java during these many workshops. I also learned how to use GitHub for the first time. Thanks to these workshops, I am able to pick up on skills and languages easier.</div>
